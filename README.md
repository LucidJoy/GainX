## Tech Highlights (Must Read)

1. **Tableland:** We store all our deals in a SQL database powered by Tableland. Only the lender and the borrower can change the terms and conditions like the tenure with **access controls**. Tableland was very easy to use and implement giving developers a seamless experience. Furthermore, the features offered by Tableland leveled up our application and a number of updates awaits post hackathon where Tableland features will be of prefect use.

2. **Axelar:** One of they key features and USP of our product is the ability to lend cross-chain which was powered by Axelar. For the time being we have demonstated cross-chain communication between Polygon Mumbai Testnet and Filecoin Hyperspace Testnet. But we plan to add more and more networks to the list and broaded our usability. 

3. **Deep Learning and Recurrent Neural Network model:** One of the major issues in today's NFT collateralized loans is valuation of NFTs. Notable companies like **NFTfi offer only 40%** of the NFT current market value **without considering the possibility of future growth**. To solve this problem we have devised a neural network model  that helps us to accurately predict the future value of an given NFT from time of the borrowing by capturing **underlying pattern and trend in realtime** . This helps find better valuation of the NFTs so that the Storage Providers get a fair price for their asset which in turn would minimise risk and maximise the profit.
